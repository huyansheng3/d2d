### remark

> "diabelb-react-scripts-ts": "^2.10.2",

it's fix baseUrl error [#203](https://github.com/wmonk/create-react-app-typescript/issues/203)
react-scripts-ts@2.13.0 has issue [#241](https://github.com/wmonk/create-react-app-typescript/issues/241)
so wait for merging (pr)(https://github.com/wmonk/create-react-app-typescript/pull/243)
